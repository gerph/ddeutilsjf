Introduction
------------
DDEUtils is very useful. However, it has many faults. One of these is that
you can't change directory whilst using it. Another is that the directory
you 'appear' to be in is not actually the directory you 'are' in; that is
it only looks to the program reading filenames that it is reading them from
the directory you appear to be in, even though it requested those from the
directory you appear to be in. That may not make sense initially, and on
the second or third reading it may sound as if it's correct, but the way
DDEUtils does it's job is not quite complete.

During the build of Perl recently there have been a number of problems
encountered with DDEUtils which may (or may not) be solved by this
re-implementation. I hope that they will be fixed as this was the purpose
of the project :-) (well, except for fixing a problem which Undelete has
with DDEUtils).


Differences between DDEUtils and DDEUtilsJF
-------------------------------------------
Note: 'This version' is DDEUtilsJF, 'Acorn's' is DDEUtils.

  - You cannot run files from the CSD in this version. (if the file is in the
    csd you cannot run it without giving a full path).
  - Acorn's sets Prefix$Dir and allows you to change it, this version does
    not.
  + Undelete works whilst a prefix is set in this version.
  + You can use *Dir to change directories in this version


Bugs
----
There are bound to be bugs in this version other than those mentioned above,
if you find any, or would like the problems fixed (or explained as to why
they cannot be fixed :-) ) you can contact me at <Gerph@innocent.com>.

Suggestions and ideas are welcome and I'm very willing to produce a new
version if there is a need.
