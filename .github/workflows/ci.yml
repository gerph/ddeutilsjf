# RISC OS CI build through build.riscos.online
#
# To reuse this configuration with your own repository:
#
#   - Create a .robuild.yaml to describe what should be built on RISC OS.
#       - `jobs.build.script` should be a list of commands to run on RISC OS
#       - `jobs.build.artifacts.path` should be the directory to zip.
#   - Create a VersionNum file if you wish to use the automated versioning
#     in the same style as the RISC OS sources. [optional]
#   - Update the 3rd step ('give the archive a versioned name') to give a
#     suitable name for the archive.
#   - Update the 4th step ('upload-artifacts') to include the same names.
#
# The 'release' job is triggered when a tag starting with a 'v' is created,
# which will create a GitHub release for the repository with the name of the
# version tag. The release will be a draft, and should be updated with
# changes as you see fit.
